<h2> Overview </h2>
Optimestics is a digital shop on Etsy that I own, offering a variety of customizable templates ranging from event planners to organizational tools created using Google Sheets and Excel. Each template is designed with unique layouts, helpful formulas, and practical features tailored to support users in their daily tasks.

Many of these templates also include automated charts and summaries that visualize the user’s data, making it easier to track progress, understand trends, and stay organized. Optimestics focuses on creating clean, functional, and user-friendly templates that provide real value to buyers.
